# Android app for YorkU students to calculate their GPA automatically.
# Tech stack: Java, Android, Jsoup library.
In this project, Jsoup library is used to parse, extract, and manipulate data from the website.
Using this app, users don't need to enter all the course information. They just need to login their YorkU passports, then they can get their GPAs in both 9.0 scale and 4.0 scale. It makes the GPA calculation and conversion super easy.
